	Description: This project consists of creation of a red-black tree under c++03 standards with documentary
                comments, so anyone having idea with a minimum of C++03 is good to go. The project consists
                of atomic and fundamental operations with RBT. Beside this there are some application modules also.  
    Prerequisites: Vanilla C++03, Pointers, OOP and vanilla BST.

Properties of RBT ->
                    1. Every node is either red or black
                    2. Root is always black
                    3. All leaves(NIL) are always black
                    4. A red node should have all it's children black
                    5. All nodes have the same black height i.e., no of black nodes from a given node to 
                       all it's descendant is same.
